# Differences between Gnosis Chain and Ethereum

Development wise, since Gnosis Chain is an Ethereum Virtual Machine based chain, development is nearly identical.

## **Why Gnosis/xDai?**

* ✅Fast transaction times (5 seconds) & low transaction fees (500 tx for $.01).
* ✅Digital cash. A stable chain is ideal for real world value exchange where 1 xDai = 1 US Dollar.
* ✅A stable token for transactions & gas fees.
* ✅A green, energy-efficient and [ecologically aware](about-gc/news-and-information/xdai-energy-efficiency/) blockchain network.
* ✅Permissionless delegated Proof-Of-Stake based consensus with public [POSDAO](for-validators/posdao-whitepaper.md).
* ✅Wide-ranging Community Support (see [xDai Validator Organizations](broken-reference)).
* ✅Extreme usability with tools like [Burner Wallet](for-users/wallets/burner-wallet/) & [Burner Wallet 2](for-users/wallets/burner-wallet-2.md).
* ✅Growing ecosystem designed to support stable person-to-person transactions, micro transactions, [conference currencies](about-gc/use-cases/cryptocurrency-for-events-and-conferences/), [community currencies](about-gc/use-cases/community-currencies.md), DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, games and more.
* ✅Full-featured  [BlockScout Explorer](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet).
* ✅On-chain, decentralized [Random Number Generator](for-developers/on-chain-random-numbers/).
