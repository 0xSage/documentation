# Transaction Fees

**Transaction Fees** (Gas fees): Transaction fees are assessed for any xDai transactions such as sending xDai to another wallet or interacting with a smart contract. These fees are currently sent to the validator who seals the block in which the transactions take place (transaction fees are not split among pool participants, they are only received by the validator). Currently, transaction fees on the xDai chain are extremely low. As chain usage grows, these fees may be redirected to support additional aspects of the protocol.
