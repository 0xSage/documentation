# Deploying a Basic Contract

Follow the same process as deploying to Ethereum

---

The Gnosis Chain is an EVM based chain, meaning deployment steps are the same as deployment to Ethereum or other chains. The required changes consist of directing deployment to the proper RPC and network id.

- **RPC**: https://rpc.gnosischain.com ([more RPCs available here](https://developers.gnosischain.com/for-developers/developer-resources#json-rpc-endpoints))
- **Network_ID**: 100


:::note
You will also need a [small amount of xDai](https://developers.gnosischain.com/for-users/get-xdai-tokens) to deploy a contract, and for any contract functions. There is no current xDai testnet, so your contracts will be live! 
For testing purposes, it is recommended to first deploy to the Sokol testnet. After functionality is tested and confirmed, deploy to the Gnosis Chain!
