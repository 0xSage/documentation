# Developers Overview

## Differences between Gnosis Chain and Ethereum

Development wise, since Gnosis Chain is an Ethereum Virtual Machine based chain, development is nearly identical.

## Why Gnosis?

* ✅Fast transaction times (5 seconds) & low transaction fees (500 tx for $.01).
* ✅A stable token for transactions & gas fees.
* ✅Permissionless delegated Proof-Of-Stake based consensus with public [POSDAO](/specs/consensus/posdao).
* ✅Wide-ranging Community Support.
* ✅Growing ecosystem designed to support stable person-to-person transactions, micro transactions, conference currencies, community currencies, DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, games and more.
* ✅Full-featured  [BlockScout Explorer](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet).
* ✅Smart Contract, DApp & toolset compatibility with other Ethereum-based chains like Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, BSC and others.

## Transaction Fees

**Transaction Fees** (Gas fees): Transaction fees are assessed for any xDai transactions such as sending xDai to another wallet or interacting with a smart contract. These fees are currently sent to the validator who seals the block in which the transactions take place (transaction fees are not split among pool participants, they are only received by the validator). Currently, transaction fees on the xDai chain are extremely low. As chain usage grows, these fees may be redirected to support additional aspects of the protocol.
