# The Merge

# Gnosis (beacon) chain merge

Gnosis will soon merge with [Gnosis beacon chain (GBC)](/specs/consensus/gbc) proof-of-stake system. This will mark the end of Gnosis Proof of Authority era and become completely permission-less. This sets up a future of greater Ethereum compatibility with its bright future and further updates to come. For more technical details, all content existing regarding the Ethereum merge applies. You can read more on[ https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/](https://ethereum.org/en/upgrades/merge/).


## **What do you need to do to be ready?**


### **Users**

You do not need to do anything. Your funds will be safe during the transition and there will not be any new token after the transition. Please beware of scams.


### **DApp developers**

The merge is designed to have minimal impact on the execution layer. There will be however some minor changes that may affect a small fraction of dApps. For more information, check out this blog post by Tim Beiko on[ How The Merge Impacts Ethereumâ€™s Application Layer](https://blog.ethereum.org/2021/11/29/how-the-merge-impacts-app-layer/)


### **Node runners**

You must **run a consensus client before the merge** alongside your existing execution client. Not doing so will cause your node to fork and not follow the right chain. Node operators can also check out the[ Merge Readiness Checklist](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/merge-readiness/) on the Staking Launchpad for more information, as many of the details apply to all node operators.


### **Stakers**

You must **run an execution client before the merge** alongside your existing consensus client. Not doing so will cause your node to fork and not follow the right chain. You must set a fee recipient address to receive your earned transaction fee tips/MEV. Stakers are encouraged to follow the[ Merge Readiness Checklist](https://launchpad.ethereum.org/en/merge-readiness/) from the Staking Launchpad to ensure readiness for The Merge
