title: Why Gnosis Chain?
---

- [ ] WIP

- About Gnosis Chain
  - High-level explanation of sidechain that is as similar to Ethereum as possible
  - Culture of experimentation and weird, wonderful dapps, an indie chain for creators and builders
  - Former xDai network, with long history since 2017 as one of the earliest sidechains of Ethereum, and fondly used by many of the early adopters of Ethereum (link to History)
  - Inspired many copycats, many of which went on to define the industry (Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Terra - copied the stablecoin-as-native-asset)
- Why Gnosis Chain?
  - Why yet another sidechain?
  - Why not just throw away xDai and move towards a rollup?
- Mission: help Ethereum succeed
  - Gnosis is one of the largest holders of ETH and is aligned to make it succeed - previously stewarded OpenEthereum, Gnosis Safe
  - Help drive technological improvements - funding core devs, divergent ideas, trying experiments to help Ethereum escape the innovator's dillemma
  - Help onboard next billion users to Ethereum and Web3 - a "play" network for devs to learn, build fun projects, that might otherwise be priced out of mainnet or even rollups (should we include a price target?)
- How are we helping Ethereum succeed?
  - A fork that is as-close to native Ethereum as possible
    - Fund core client development without too many changes (vs other forks)
    - Commitment to using treasury to further Ethereum development
    - All improvements to be submitted as EIPs (vs GIPs)
  - We see the need for chain where we can push the limits of Ethereum 
    - Selectively use Gnosis to trial improvements
    - Erigon as an execution layer, with view to reduce txn fees
    - BLS signatures, etc
    - MEV resistance - https://ethresear.ch/t/shutterized-beacon-chain/12249 
  - More useful to Ethereum development than EVM forks
    - More eyes on deck, minimal changes to core client code
    - Funding used to supplement existing Ethereum client teams
    - Benchmark: Binance Smart Chain
    - Competitors: non-Beacon chain based EVMs (e.g. Fantom, Polygon PoS, Moonbeam)
  - Continue to push boundaries on sidechains (vs only scaling via rollups)
    - Rollups continue to be experimental technology
    - Rollup transactions are still likely to cost a high amount 
      - due to data availability and state rent
      - a rollup without DA might as well be a side chain) - 16 gas per byte
      - the xDai transaction today costs - ?
      - a rollup on xDai costs - ?
    - There needs to be additional dimensions apart from "only rollups", and we see the need to fund alternative design decisions  
      - Trustless bridges
      - Merge mining and establishing synchrony between chains 
    - It is possible that Gnosis may itself become a rollup in the future as tech matures
- A People-run Network
  - Lower the price of running a validator so that as many people around the globe can run one (vs Ethereum)
  - Vision: run a node in every country
  - Decentralization is very important
  - Working towards a more equitable token distribution: there are some projects where Jump has 70% of all tokens
  - Anyone can be a infrastructure operator, Community-owned infrastructure
- Expanding access
  - Commit to work with EF to fund developer and user education efforts in emerging markets
  - Cheap, mostly empty blocks allows for devs in emerging markets to play with cheap transactions on an interface which mostly looks and feels like Ethereum
  - Native stablecoin-as-gas allows for Venmo like experience (easier onboarding for people to Web3)
  - Possibly use the treasury to subsidize validator network, to run nodes
  - Circles UBI project
- Culture
  - Weird, experimental and novel projects
  - Dark Forest, zk experiments etc, Perpetual protocol, POAPs, HOPR
  - Where weird and quirky lives on, even as Web3 puts on a shirt and a tie and becomes more corporate
  - A place for experimentation. The early days of Ethereum were more fun with artists, hackers and weirdos. 

- Community + Culture narrative
  - “The DAO Chain”, “Chain that the OGs deploy on”
  - “Hipster Chain”,
  - ZK Stuff (?)
  - “We want to be the home of experimentation”
- Privacy
  - HOPR is on Gnosis Chain
  - zkBridge can have optional privacy when bridging in or out
- Dai as a native coin
  - Can leverage the MakerDAO
