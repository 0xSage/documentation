title: Why Gnosis Chain?
---

- [ ] WIP

- About Gnosis Chain
  - High-level explanation of sidechain that is as similar to Ethereum as possible
  - Culture of experimentation and weird, wonderful dapps, an indie chain for creators and builders
  - Former xDai network, with long history since 2017 as one of the earliest sidechains of Ethereum, and fondly used by many of the early adopters of Ethereum (link to History)
  - Inspired many copycats, many of which went on to define the industry (Polygon, Binance Smart Chain, Terra - copied the stablecoin-as-native-asset)
- Why Gnosis Chain?
  - Why yet another sidechain?
  - Why not just throw away xDai and move towards a rollup?
- Mission: help Ethereum succeed
  - Gnosis is one of the largest holders of ETH and is aligned to make it succeed - previously stewarded OpenEthereum, Gnosis Safe
  - Help drive technological improvements - funding core devs, divergent ideas, trying experiments to help Ethereum escape the innovator's dillemma
  - Help onboard next billion users to Ethereum and Web3 - a "play" network for devs to learn, build fun projects, that might otherwise be priced out of mainnet or even rollups (should we include a price target?)
- How are we helping Ethereum succeed?
  - A fork that is as-close to native Ethereum as possible
    - Fund core client development without too many changes (vs other forks)
    - Commitment to using treasury to further Ethereum development
    - All improvements to be submitted as EIPs
  - Selectively use Gnosis to trial improvements
    - Erigon execution layer
    - BLS signatures
  - More useful to Ethereum development than EVM forks
    - More eyes on deck
    - Funding used to supplement existing Ethereum client teams
    - Benchmark: Binance Smart Chain
    - Competitors: non-Beacon chain based EVMs (e.g. Fantom, Polygon PoS, Moonbeam)
  - Continue to push boundaries on sidechains (vs only having rollups)
    - Data availability and state rent
    - Trustless bridges
    - Merge mining and establishing synchrony between chains 
- A People-run Network
  - Lower the price of running a validator so that as many people around the globe can run one (vs Ethereum)
- Culture
  - Native stablecoin-as-gas allows for Venmo like experience (easier onboarding for people to Web3)
  - Cheap, mostly empty blocks allows for devs in emerging markets to play with cheap transactions on an interface which mostly looks and feels like Ethereum
