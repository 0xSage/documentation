title: Roadmap
---

- Ethereum-aligned
  -  Gnosis is one of the largest holders of ETH on planet earth 
  - Canary Network - is this a valid narrative and roadmap?


- “Decentralizing the Beacon Chain” 
  - Decentralizing the beacon chain
  - Already today, the Gnosis Beacon Chain could be called the 2nd most decentralized POS network after Ethereum, leaving the competition trailing when it comes to validator count. We want to continuously be a place for solo validators and maximal decentralization through people running their own validators at home.
  - It is important that neither the total capital staked nor the number of validators is important but the diversity of the validators. A network where a large trading firm like Jump Trading stakes 1b is by no means more secure than a network with thousands of small participants.
  - We can further incentivize small stakes, e.g., with various proof of personhood protocols (Proof of humanity, Humannode, Circles, ..) Ideally, we can combine that with ZK technology to prove the personhood of a validator without directly tying a validator to a public identity.
  - A node operator in every country
    - Anyone can be a infrastructure operator, Community-owned infrastructure
    - 1 GNO and a dAppNode in your home 
  - A great contrast to chains that effectively run in 3 datacenters 
- Trustless Sidechain to Ethereum

  - Innovating on how this is possible
  - Once we have high security through a very diverse validator set, we can upgrade the bridges (both xDAI and ABM) to a model that inherits the full security of the validator set by running a light client of GC and Ethereum and vice versa. This will ensure that Gnosis Chain has a highly secure bridge infrastructure. Assuming BLS precompiles will be introduced on Ethereum, this will be possible as outlined by the xDAI team a while ago already, alternatively, it can be done with ZK technology that is available already on Ethereum.
- Funding core clients
  - Pushing the limit of how Execution Layer can go
  - Erigon research and Erigon database have a lot of potential to push limits of what's possible on EVM without reducing decentralization
  - We are extremely happy to have set up longterm agreements with 2 of the top client teams in the Ethereum space. We believe that Erigon has pushed the limits of what is possible how far to scale an EVM client without giving up on a single global state. Nethermind has an experienced team and provided an production ready client since many years. To truly make use of the performance improvements made possible by the Erigon research it is important that other clients can apply them as well. The Nethermind team committed to apply the Erigon database layout to their client and once that is ready we believe we can push the limits of what is possible on a EVM without giving up the idea that individuals can run a validator.
- Real World Usage
  - Account Abstraction: We believe that the UX and security challenges of EOAs are still a big reason for blockchain applications to not yet be able to reach a mass market. With account abstraction (smart contract wallet = Gnosis Safe) it will be possible to give users a better UX. This includes social recovery, batching transactions, scheduled transactions on their behalf. On a chain level there are various things how we can support the spread of smart contract accounts: support gasless transactions via EIP4337,
- Circles
  - A lot of work has happened here that is not yet visible. But soon, there will be a relaunch of Circles with additional token models that will make sure people can use their Circles in as many places as possible, all powered by GC. This will be a great onboarding opportunity for users. If users reach a specific level of activity they can get the offer to become a validator on GC - increasing the decentralization of GC while at the same time the validator income can be one of many parts to support the value of the UBI.
