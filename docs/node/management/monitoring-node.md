* Prysm: [https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/prysm-usage/monitoring/grafana-dashboard/](https://docs.prylabs.network/docs/prysm-usage/monitoring/grafana-dashboard/)

You can also view your validator status on the [Gnosis Beacon Chain explorer](https://beacon.gnosischain.com/validators). To view your validator, you can search for it by using its public key.
