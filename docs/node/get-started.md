# Validator Info

Validators protect the Gnosis Chain by staking on the Gnosis Beacon Chain. There are several options now available for staking.

## Run Your Own Node

Please view these [important notes](/node/consensus-layer-validator#before-starting) and [Technical Requirements](/node/consensus-layer-validator#beacon-chain-node-requirements) to learn more about expectations and what you will need to become a validator. Validating the GBC requires 1 GNO per validator process.

:::note
DappNode now supports the Gnosis Beacon Chain! If you would like to use their services for validation, please see the [guide and instructions here](https://forum.dappnode.io/t/how-to-setup-a-gnosis-beacon-chain-gbc-validator-on-dappnode/1351)

## ðŸ’§ Liquid Staking
Liquid staking is a great way to help secure Gnosis Chain and earn yield without having to run any infrastructure. [Read more here](/tools/beacon-chain/liquid-staking).

:bulb:Want to learn the basics about validating on the beacon chain? [This is a good first article to start](https://medium.com/alethio/ethereum-2-a-validators-journey-through-the-beacon-chain-843f70aaab2e) (covers the Ethereum Beacon Chain, but processes are similar on GBC only faster: 5 sec blocks and 16 slots per epoch).
