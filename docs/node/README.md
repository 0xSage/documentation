# Gnosis Beacon Chain

Gnosis Beacon Chain (GBC) brings extendable and accelerated beacon-network functionality to the Ethereum ecosystem. Applications can iterate through real-world strategies, stage important applications, or choose to run DApps in a faster, lower-stakes environment while enjoying the benefits of massive scalability.

GBC is optimized for certain parameters (block/epoch time) and can serve in a frontrunning capacity to important Ethereum consensus-layer updates. For example, the merge will first take place on testnets. Once thorough testing is complete, updates can then move to a production-level, real-world value environment (Gnosis Beacon Chain).

Validating on the GBC only requires the equivalent of 1 [GNO](/about/tokens/gno), opening up validation opportunities for diverse groups of individuals across the globe. When you go to make the deposit, that 1 GNO is split into 32 mGNO to more closely mirror Ethereum, where you stake 32 ETH.
