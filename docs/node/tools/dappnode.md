# DAppNode

[DAppNode](https://dappnode.io/) is a simple platform for deploying and hosting DApps, P2P clients, and blockchain nodes. It provides a user-friendly way to set up and configure nodes with a couple of clicks.

There are two ways to use DAppNode:
1. Purchase one of their pre-installed [DAppNode servers](https://dappnode.io/collections/all). They currently come with four free Gnosis validators.
2. Install DAppNode on any compatible hardware or a VPS. The installation is done using the command line interface (CLI) by following the [Installing DAppNode on Custom Hardware](#custom-hardware) steps below.

## Using DAppNode {#install-on-dappnode}

### Step 1: Installation of Execution Client

Install the **Nethermind xDai (Gnosis Chain)** package from the [DAppStore](http://my.dappnode/#/installer). **You cannot use a third party node as your execution client after the merge.** It may take several days for the node to fully sync.

**While connected to your DAppNode**, click the link below and continue with the `Install` button.
- **[Nethermind xDai (Gnosis Chain)](http://my.dappnode/#/installer/nethermind-xdai.dnp.dappnode.eth)**

### Step 2: Install Gnosis Beacon Chain + Validator (Consensus Client)

You can currently select and install 3 different implementations of the Gnosis Beacon Chain + Validator from the DAppStore.

- [Teku](http://my.dappnode/#/installer/teku-gnosis.dnp.dappnode.eth)
- [Lighthouse](http://my.dappnode/#/installer/lighthouse-gnosis.dnp.dappnode.eth)

![DAppNode Step 2](/img/node/dappnode-step2.jpeg)

Once you click through to `Install` , you will be in the **Setup Page**:
![DAppNode Step 2b](/img/node/dappnode-step2b.png)

You will be able to choose the following options:

**Graffiti**

Choose a string that will be appended to your proposed blocks. You will be able to change later so it can be left as is for now.

**Gnosis Chain Node URL**

Enter the  following link in the **XDAI_RPC_URL** field of the Beacon Chain section.

`http://nethermind-xdai.dappnode:8545`

**Checkpoint for fast sync**

To get your beacon node up and running in only a few minutes, you can start it from a recent finalized checkpoint state rather than syncing from genesis. This is substantially¬†**faster** and consumes¬†**fewer resources** than syncing from genesis while still providing all the same features. 

Be sure you are using a trusted node for the fast sync. Get your checkpoint sync from a running Gnosis Beacon Chain node or use the official one.
¬†
`https://checkpoint.gnosischain.com`

**Fee Recipient Address**

The fee recipient is the regular Gnosis `0x` address that will receive priority fees of the proposed block. You will only receive fees at this address for blocks you propose, not for attestations. Any Gnosis EOA or Safe address 

**Web3Signer**

When installing your Gnosis Beacon Chain client, the Web3Signer will also be installed as a dependency. **Make sure you select the client you are installing.** The Web3Signer will hold the validator keys and will be connected to this client in order to submit the validator tasks.

After you submit the configuration, accept the disclaimer and install it, then you can let it sync and move on to the next step.

### Step 3: Key Generation

:::caution KEEP YOUR KEYSTORES SAFE
We highly recommend generating keystores on a safe, completely offline device. To do so, you will need internet to access the latest release of Gnosis Chain Port of the Wagyu Key-Gen from [GitHub](https://github.com/alexpeterson91/wagyu-key-gen/releases) (step 1), then disconnect internet or better yet copy the program to a USB drive to proceed with completely offline key generation (step 2), then finally save your deposit_data.json file (step 3) to a usb key or other transfer method that does not require online connection.

**Securely backup your mnemonic, keystores, and password, and keep them in a safe place.**

:::

1. Download the latest release of the Gnosis Wagyu Key Gen from [here](https://github.com/alexpeterson91/wagyu-key-gen/releases). There are binaries posted for Windows, macOS, Linux AMD64, and Linux ARM64, choose the appropriate binary for your OS, (or build from the source code if you‚Äôre so inclined).

  ![DAppNode Step 3b](/img/node/dappnode-step3b.png)

2. Once you have downloaded the appropriate binary for your OS and are disconnected from the internet, go ahead and open the program.  You will be given 2 options, either create a new mnemonic or import an existing mnemonic.  The GUI is very user friendly and explains all steps along the way.  Below are screenshots showing the flow for creating a new mnemonic.  If importing a mnemonic you will need to ensure you select the proper start index on the configuration page so that you don‚Äôt create duplicate keys.

  ![DAppNode Step 3c](/img/node/dappnode-step3c.png)

  ![DAppNode Step 3d](/img/node/dappnode-step3d.png)

  ![DAppNode Step 3e](/img/node/dappnode-step3e.png)

  ![DAppNode Step 3f](/img/node/dappnode-step3f.png)

  You will be shown this once again before you need to confirm it by entering each word one at a time.

  ![DAppNode Step 3g](/img/node/dappnode-step3g.png)

  ![DAppNode Step 3h](/img/node/dappnode-step3h.png)

  Fill this with the mnemonic you just created to confirm.

  ![DAppNode Step 3i](/img/node/dappnode-step3i.png)

  ![DAppNode Step 3j](/img/node/dappnode-step3j.png)

  :::info 
  If you are running this program to generate keys within the context of the DAppNode <\> Gnosis Chain Hardware Validator Incentive Program, make sure to generate 4 validators and to fill in the ETH1 Withdrawal Address Field with an address you have full control over.  Also make sure to choose a directory that reflects the folder where you want the files to be saved.
  :::

  ![DAppNode Step 3k](/img/node/dappnode-step3k.png)

  Confirm your keystore password.

  ![DAppNode Step 3l](/img/node/dappnode-step3l.png)

  Select the folder where your keys should be saved.

  ![DAppNode Step 3m](/img/node/dappnode-step3m.png)

  ![DAppNode Step 3n](/img/node/dappnode-step3n.png)

  Confirm that your keys have been generated.

  ![DAppNode Step 3o](/img/node/dappnode-step3o.png)

  The key generation is complete, and your keys have been saved to the folder you selected.

### Step 4: Upload Keystores to Web3Signer

Now that you‚Äôve generated your deposit data and keystores, go ahead and upload your keystores to Web3Signer Gnosis.

Return to your DAppNode‚Äôs Admin UI and navigate to the [info page of the Web3Signer Gnosis package](http://my.dappnode/#/packages/web3signer-gnosis.dnp.dappnode.eth/info).

![DAppNode Step 4](/img/node/dappnode-step4.png)

Open the UI by clicking the [`üè†Ui`](http://ui.web3signer-gnosis.dappnode/) link, then click the `Import Keystores`  button on the lower part of the Web3Signer UI.

![DAppNode Step 4b](/img/node/dappnode-step4b.png)

Select the keystore file(s) you generated the the password you chose during the last step.

![DAppNode Step 4c](/img/node/dappnode-step4c.png)

You will be able to see all the keystores you‚Äôve uploaded.

![DAppNode Step 4d](/img/node/dappnode-step4d.png)

You are now ready to fund these validators and start validating.

### Step 5: Fund Your Validators

:::tip 
In case you need some xDai for transaction fees you can get some from the [official xDai faucet for Gnosis](https://stakely.io/en/faucet/gnosis-chain-xdai).

:::

1. Navigate to: [https://deposit.gnosischain.com/](https://deposit.gnosischain.com/)
2. Connect your wallet.
3. Upload the `deposit_data*.json` you generated with the key generator tool in Step 3.
4. Your deposit file will be validated and list the number of validator deposits you are making and the required GNO to deposit. Click `Deposit` to continue.
5. Check that you understand the risks and ensure you are interacting with the correct contract before proceeding.
6. Click `Ok` and confirm the transaction in your wallet to complete the deposit.

6. Our proxy smart contract will deposit the 4 GNO to your validators! YOU control the private keys, YOU control the withdrawal key... these validators are now **yours**. Take good care of them!

:::tip  DAppNode <\> Gnosis Chain Incentive Program
If you are claiming the 4 Gnosis validators from the incentive program, select the DAppNode tab instead. Be sure to use the same wallet that you provided when placing your DAppNode order.

If you encounter an issue claiming your incentive program validators, such as an error about your address not being whitelisted or that it has expired, please visit the [DAppNode Discord Server](https://discord.gg/dappnode) and open a support ticket in  [`#1-sales-support-ticket`](https://discord.gg/mGtA9emHw3).

## Installing DAppNode on Custom Hardware {#custom-hardware}

A community written guide by @GLCstaked which goes into detail the entire setup process for a validator using linux with docker. This is for beginners new to linux who wish to get familiar with every step of the process and configuration. Can be found [here](https://mirror.xyz/0xf3bF9DDbA413825E5DdF92D15b09C2AbD8d190dd/wkE51RqApadbSW1GQartYJ5Jz71mnz2y60TNu3XNtNM)

1. Start with a fresh installation of Debian or Ubuntu.
2. Log in with an account with `sudo` privileges.
3. Install the prerequisites: [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/), [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/), and [xz](https://tukaani.org/xz/). The prerequisites can be installed manually or by using this command:
  `curl https://prerequisites.dappnode.io | sudo sh`
4. Run the installer script to install DAppNode:
   `curl https://installer.dappnode.io | sudo sh`
5. Once the installation has finished, reboot your machine:
   `sudo shutdown -r now`
6. DAppNode will try to automatically prepare for the first access. DAppNode's official documentation explains how to connect using the [four supported connection methods](https://docs.dappnode.io/get-started/installation/custom-hardware/installation/script#post-installation).
7. Once you have successfully connected to DAppNode, follow the [Using DAppNode](#install-on-dappnode) steps above.
