## Withdrawals

### When can I make a withdrawal from a validator?

There is currently no concrete date for withdrawals of staked GNO. Please note that validator deposits are a non-reversible, one-way transaction. Gnosis will likely follow a similar timeline to Ethereum in enabling withdrawals post-merge. 

## Security

### Help! I've lost my validator keys

You are responsible for your keys (deriving and storing your keys and mnemonic securely). If you lose them or your keys are compromised, there is no recourse to recover your funds.
